## Bugs
1. when a list is generated, swap(Create, Regenerate)
   but if list name is edited after generation, swap shouldn't take place
2. sort by itemList name asc, desc, most recently used
3. on deleting / selecting from home and searchview, screen is scrolling up unlike trashactivity
4. if currently in homeactivity, list item should be highlighted in navigation
5. if an inappropriate search is made, then the result should mention it, hiding the add list and recyclerview in makelistActivity
6. select all, unselect the first list. delete. the first list also gets deleted
7.
